Q1 Sales Planning Meeting
January 16, 2026

The meeting focused on three key areas for Q1 2026: pipeline management, operational readiness, and marketing initiatives.

The enterprise pipeline shows strong momentum with 12 deals valued at $2.3 million in potential ARR. The largest opportunity is a company expansion from 200 to 500 licenses, with an 85% confidence level on closing. The proposal needs to be submitted by Friday, January 19th, and success metrics from the pilot program should be included to strengthen the ROI case.

To handle the anticipated increase in customer volume, the team plans to hire two additional implementation specialists within 4-6 weeks. Temporary contractors will be brought in to bridge the gap, with proposals expected by Monday, January 21st. The CRM system also needs upgrading to an enterprise plan at $15,000 per year to handle performance issues and provide advanced analytics capabilities.

Marketing will launch three major campaigns in Q1. A webinar series on industry best practices will start in February with one session per month. A partnership with TechInsights magazine for sponsored content is being finalized. Most importantly, a referral program will launch on February 1st, offering 10% discounts for qualified leads and 20% for converted customers. The program messaging needs approval by January 24th, and a training session for the customer success team will be scheduled for the last week of January.

The team has set an ambitious target of $3.5 million in new ARR for Q1, representing a 40% increase over Q4. To support this goal, a proposal automation tool will be implemented to reduce turnaround time from 3-4 days to same-day generation. The customer success team will also expand by two members to maintain service quality with the increased customer base.

Key deadlines include: proposal submission by January 19th, contractor proposals by January 21st, referral program messaging approval by January 24th, and CSM hiring to be completed by end of Q1.
